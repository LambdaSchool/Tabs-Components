							Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many
							people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the
							nature of the Universe than we do now.

						<div class="tabs-item-title">Quote 3</div>
						<div class="tabs-item-description">
							It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to
							be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite
							number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe
							can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people
							you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.

						<div class="tabs-item-title">Quote 4</div>
						<div class="tabs-item-description">
							There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will
							instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states
							that this has already happened.

							Touch water with paw then recoil in horror nya nya nyan, jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, climb a tree,
